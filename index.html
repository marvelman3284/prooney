    <h3 class="overview"> Overview:</h3>
    <p> One of the most important aspects of fitness is training. Training has countless benefits,
      <br>
      such as, weight management, strengthened bones and muscles, increased lifespan, among
      <br>
      many other things. In this section I will focus on two main aspects of training:
      <br>
      strength and cariovascular conditioning. I will also spend time discussing a crosssection
      <br>
      of these two aspects: CrossFit training.
      <br>
      First, let's discuss strength training. For a beginner or someone with a busy schedule,
      <br>
      three thirty to forty-five minute sessions per week is sufficient. For those who are more
      <br>
      advanced or have more time, you can train more often, but I would not exceed five or six
      strength
      <br>
      sessions per week. I will address this more in depth in the "recovery" section, but for now
      <br>
      let's stick to a three time per week plan. For this type of plan, I recommend doing one upper
      <br>
      body workout, one lower body workout, and one full body workout. For all of these workouts,


      <br>
      we will focus on compound movements. Compound movements workout multiple muscle groups
      <br>
      against the most resistance, therefore they are the most efficient exercises. For upper body,
      <br>
      pick one compound movement that targets the chest muscles, one that targets the back muscles,
      <br>
      and one that that targets the shoulders.
